<center>Vue js crashcourse</center>

On day 61 of #100DaysOfALXSE
Today i continued learning of Vue by learning:
========================================
===> Conditional Rendering
This is showing content based on a user requirement like loging in.
In order to do this we use a v-if
An altenative to v-if is v-show
v-show is best because it enables the elements to be displayed in a block manner. 
If not shown the elements have a display property of none.

In this session, I've created a list of items which can only be displayed when a button is clicked
else they are not shown.

Today i dived into outputting lists using vue js, using the v-for, this is very useful because in most situations we need to output lists so that we can be able to hsow alot of data. In this case: 
                                                        ==> I will use arrays and object for more info see the code.

Also learned about dynamic binding
